Problem Statement

The aim of this project is to develop an application specially for students moving to a new place which will help them find good place within budget and roommates with similar interests and preferences. We also plan on linking local brokers and landlords along with their listings and helping students connect with them over the application to finalize a place and provide them with a safe gateway to make payments. This eliminates any sort of fraud and risks associated with making transfers internationally and provides assurance to both the brokers and the students.

The main objectives of the project can be summarized as follows:
1. Help students find roommates and an apartment all under one application
2. Provide students with listings depending on budget and location preferences
3. Connect local brokers and landlords directly to students via the application
